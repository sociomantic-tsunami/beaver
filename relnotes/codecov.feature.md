* `beaver dlang codecov`

  This is a convenience command that will run [codecov-bash](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-bash) (to send coverage reports to [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/)) in a confined docker container, only with the coverage files in it.

  Have a look at the README for more details.
