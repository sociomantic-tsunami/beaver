## New command to convert tags to D2 and release them via GitHub

`dlang d2-release`

For D1 projects that are compatible with D2, there is a new special command that allows automatically converting to D2, tagging (using the suffix `+d2`), pushing to the repo and creating a GitHub release.

Please refer to the *README* for details on how to use this.
